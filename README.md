# NeuroPy

Main TODO:
- [ ] Understand how BrainPy Work
- [ ] Know something about Computational NeuroScience
- [ ] Main Feature of NeuroPy
    - building, simulation, training, analysis

## Main Features 
## Building
- [ ] how to build a computational brain
- [ ] the step?
- [ ] what is a brain, main function util today's understanding

## Simulation
- [ ] how to use computer to build a brain and know its function
- [ ] how to save computational cost? or the cost is high or low?

## Training
- [ ] what to train? is it like machine learning?
  
## Analysis
- [ ] like visualization? data science?

main relies, pytorch and numpy
