# NeuroPy

Main TODO:
- [ ] Understand how BrainPy Work
  - [ ] Read the document
  - [ ] Read the source code
- [ ] Know something about Computational NeuroScience
  - [ ] https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/index.html
  - [ ] https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html
- [ ] Main Feature of NeuroPy
    - building, simulation, training, analysis
    - 1. simulation & building
    - 2. training
    - 3. analysis

## Main Features 
## Building
- [ ] how to build a computational brain
- [ ] the step?
- [ ] what is a brain, main function util today's understanding

## Simulation
- [ ] how to use computer to build a brain and know its function
- [ ] how to save computational cost? or the cost is high or low?

## Training
- [ ] what to train? is it like machine learning?
  
## Analysis
- [ ] like visualization? data science?

main relies, pytorch and numpy
